# QNearbyShare

QNearbyShare is a [Nearby Share](https://support.google.com/files/answer/10514188?hl=en) client.

Currently, QNearbyShare has been tested with the following Nearby Share implementations:

| Implementation                                  | Send to | Receive from |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Android                                         | No*     | Yes          |
| Nearby Share Beta (Windows)                     | No      | Yes          |
| QNearbyShare                                    | Yes     | Yes          |
| [NearDrop](https://github.com/grishka/NearDrop) | Yes     | Yes          |

*Devices with "Quick Share" are no longer compatible with QNearbyShare, as there is no known way to initiate receive mode from the device.
